# Flexbox

* The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height \(and order\) to best fill the available space \(mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes\).
* A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

**NOTE:**     **Flexbox** layout is most appropriate to the _**components of an application, and small-scale layouts**_, while the **Grid** layout is intended for _**larger scale layouts**_.
{% endhint %}

## **Major Features:**

* Features flex-containers \(row\)/parent element and flex-items \(cells\)/child elements. Both are

  required to work.

* Excels at vertical centering and equal heights
* Very easy to reorder boxes
